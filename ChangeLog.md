XP Compiler ChangeLog
========================================================================

## ?.?.? / ????-??-??

* Added backwards compatible emitter (-E php5.2) to create non-namespaced
  code for use with XP 5.8 and PHP 5.2 - (@thekid)
* Changed default behaviour to creating namespaced code (compatible with 
  XP 5.9 and PHP 5.3+) - (@thekid)
* Changed "-E" command line argument to support versions: `-E name` will 
  load xp.compiler.emit.name.Emitter, `-E name60` will load the class
  xp.compiler.emit.name.V60Emitter - (@thekid)
* Changed all emit*() methods in xp.compiler.emit.Emitter to protected
  (@thekid)

## 1.11.1 / 2013-10-06

* Changed runner to create unique class names in `xcc [-e|-w]` for testing
  reasons - (@thekid)
* Fixed anonymous instance creation to create unique class names, thus
  preventing "Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class ..." errors.
  (@thekid)

## 1.11.0 / 2013-10-05

* Heads up: Changed xp.compiler.types.Types implementations to return an 
  array of Parameter objects holding name, type and optional default value 
  instead of just the parameters' types - (@thekid)
* Made error message more verbose when syntax cannot be determined from
  file referenced by command line argument - (@thekid)
* Fixed Fatal error: Class 'xp\compiler\ClassLoader' not found when using
  command line argument `-cp` - (@thekid)

* Fixed issue #32 - Fatal error during compilation (@thekid)

## 1.10.1 / 2013-05-14

* Changed emitter command line argument from "-e" to "-E"! See pull 
  request #30 - "-e" is now for command line code evaluation. - (@thekid)

  usage and contribution overviews and a small sourcecode example. See
  https://github.com/xp-framework/xp-language - (@thekid)
* Changed code no longer to use xp::$registry but instead the flattened
  version. This bumps the minimum XP Framework version to XP 5.9.0.
  See also https://github.com/xp-framework/xp-framework/pull/270 - (@thekid)

  # See xp-framework/xp-framework#160 - (@thekid)

## 1.1.2 / 2012-07-09

* Fixed indexers and operators inheritance - (@thekid)
* Added Maven pom - (@mrosoiu)

## 1.1.1 / 2012-06-08

  http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/#numbers
  See also PHP Bug #61095 and PHP Bug #61095 - (@thekid)
* Added support for hexadecimal escape sequences
  `\x   hex-digit   hex-digitopt   hex-digitopt   hex-digitopt` - (@thekid)
* Added support for exponent and octal number notation - (@thekid)
* RFC 0218: Added syntactical support for annotations with target - (@thekid)

  public interface Test { void testIt(); } - (@thekid)
* Fixed extension methods - (@thekid)
* Refactored so that uses() will be emitted once at the top of the file
  and include all dependencies merged together. - (@thekid)
* Added logic to exclude bootstrap classes from being listed in uses(),
  they are globally available. Increases generated code's loading
  performance. - (@thekid)

## 1.0.2 / 2011-12-08

* Fixed arrays of array, map and generic types not being supported - (@thekid)
* Added field annotations - (@mrosoiu)

* Fixed weird bug with compiled types being overwritten - (@thekid)
* Migrated repository to github.com (for the records) - (@thekid, @iigorr, @kiesel, @invadersmustdie)

## 1.0.0 / 2011-01-11

* Changed XP language to depend on 5.8.0 - (@thekid)
* Implemented RFC 0052 - Make XP its own (compiled) language - (@thekid)
* Fixed chaining after function calls - (@thekid)
* Fix assignments to assignments ($i= $j= 0; e.g.) being parsed in
  incorrect order - (@thekid)
* Changed map syntax to also support keys without quotes - (@thekid)
* Improved performance in self / parent lookup - (@thekid)
* Implemented auto-properties: public int id { get; set; }
  Equivalent of declaring a member variable and using an assignment
  inside set { } to $value and and a return statement with the member
  inside get { } - (@thekid)
* Implemented dynamic instance creation - (@thekid)
* Implemented dynamic member access - (@thekid)
* Added "-v" command line option for verbose output - (@thekid)
* Implemented ARM blocks in XP language, supported by lang.Closeable 
  interface in framework.
  http://news.planet-xp.net/article/397/2010/12/31/ - (@thekid)
* Implemented operator overloading - Works only inside XP language! - (@thekid)

## 0.9.2 / 2010-03-06

* Added |, &, ^, << and >> operators as well as their assignments - (@thekid)
* Implemented class constants
  Class constants are limited to numbers, booleans and strings but provide
  a cheap way of extracting magic constants from business logic. If you 
  require more flexibility, use static fields - (@thekid)
* Enabled creation of package classes (see RFC 0037) via "package class" - (@thekid)

## 0.9.1 / 2010-02-14

* Implemented unchecked casts (EXPR as TYPE?)
  Good for: return $a instanceof self && ($a as self?).compareTo(...). Now 
  it wouldn`t make sense to cast-check $a at runtime because it can NEVER 
  be anything else than of type "self" after the && (we checked it right 
  before) - but the compiler cannot know that:) - (@thekid)

## 0.9.0 / 2010-02-05

* Removed last OEL leftovers - emitter and tests - (@thekid)

## 0.8.0 / 2009-10-30

* Fixed type calculation in chains like $class.getMethods()[0].getName(); - (@thekid)
* Implemented with statement - e.g. with ($child= $n.addChild(new Node()) { ... } - (@thekid)

## 0.7.1 / 2009-10-17

* Changed runner to ext with non-zero exitcode if any of the compilation
  tasks fail (e.g. xcc src/A.xp src/B.xp - if A.xp fails, the entire
  run is marked as failed). Can be used for chaining xcc [files] && echo 
  "OK", also useful in makefiles which will stop after failure - (@thekid)

## 0.7.0 / 2009-10-11

* Implement lambdas - (@thekid)

## 0.6.0 / 2009-10-05

* Defaulted emitter to "source"
  To compile w/ oel, use `xcc -e oel [target [target [...]]] - (@thekid)

## 0.5.0 / 2009-05-03

* Implemented or-equal (|=), and-equal(&=), xor-equal (^=) and 
  div-equal (/=) - (@thekid)
* Created own nodes for true, false and null, refactored numbers into:
  . NumberNode
  |- NaturalNode
  |  - IntegerNode
  |  - HexNode
  |- DecimalNode - (@thekid)

## 0.4.0 / 2009-04-10

* Implemented try ... finally (without catch) - (@thekid)

## 0.3.0 / 2009-03-26

* First shot: Added PHP grammar for XP classes - 5.3+ w/o alternative syntax - (@thekid)

## 0.2.0 / 2009-03-08

* Changed syntax for maps from "{ key => value }" to "[ key : value ]"
  Inspired by http://groovy.codehaus.org/Collections#Collections-Maps - (@thekid)

## 0.1.0 / 2009-03-08

* Used "." as object operator instead of "->" - (@thekid)
* Changed foreach syntax from foreach ([expression] as [assignment]) to 
  foreach ([assignment] in [expression]) - (@thekid)
* Implemented varargs, annotations, anonymous instance creaton, properties,
  indexers, properties (via __get and __set), ?: shorthand - (@thekid)
* Implemented class literal - (@thekid)
* Implemented "import native" and "import static" - (@thekid)
* Made it possible to pass either:
  . XP source file (.xp)
  . PHP source file with XP class (.class.php)
  . Fully qualified class name - (@thekid)
* Added optimizations for:
  . Concatenating two constant values
  . Adding two constant values
  . Subtracting two constant values
  . Multiplying two constant values
  . Dividing two constant values - (@thekid)
* Implemented $array->length - (@thekid)

## 0.0.2 / 2008-02-20

* Added support for generic syntax - (@thekid)
* Added support for finally - (@thekid)
* Added initial implementation of map literals (require a prefix "map") - (@thekid)
