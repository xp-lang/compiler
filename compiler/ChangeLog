  usage and contribution overviews and a small sourcecode example. See

Version 1.0.0, released 2011-01-11
----------------------------------
SVN version: 15183 

Heads up!
~~~~~~~~~
- Changed XP language to depend on 5.8.0
  (friebe)

RFCs
~~~~
- Implemented RFC #0052 - Make XP its own (compiled) language
  (friebe)

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~
- Fixed chaining after function calls
  (friebe)
- Fix assignments to assignments ($i= $j= 0; e.g.) being parsed in
  incorrect order
  (friebe)

~~~~~~~~

  (friebe)
- Improved performance in self / parent lookup
  (friebe)

  inside get { }
  (friebe)

  (friebe)
- Implemented dynamic member access
  (friebe)

  (friebe)


Version 0.9.2, released 2010-03-06
----------------------------------
SVN version: 12155

Features
~~~~~~~~
- Added |, &, ^, << and >> operators as well as their assignments
  (friebe)
- Implemented class constants
  Class constants are limited to numbers, booleans and strings but provide
  a cheap way of extracting magic constants from business logic. If you 
  require more flexibility, use static fields
  (friebe)
- Enabled creation of package classes (see RFC #0037) via "package class"
  (friebe)

Version 0.9.1, released 2010-02-14
----------------------------------
SVN version: 12084

Features
~~~~~~~~
- Implemented unchecked casts (EXPR as TYPE?)
  Good for: return $a instanceof self && ($a as self?).compareTo(...). Now 
  it wouldn`t make sense to cast-check $a at runtime because it can NEVER 
  be anything else than of type "self" after the && (we checked it right 
  before) - but the compiler cannot know that:)
  (friebe)


Version 0.9.0, released 2010-02-05
----------------------------------
SVN version: 11948

Heads up!
~~~~~~~~~
- Removed last OEL leftovers - emitter and tests
  (friebe)


Version 0.8.0, released 2009-10-30
----------------------------------
SVN version: 11745

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~
- Fixed type calculation in chains like $class.getMethods()[0].getName();
  (friebe)

Features
~~~~~~~~
- Implemented with statement - e.g. with ($child= $n.addChild(new Node()) { ... }
  (friebe)


Version 0.7.1, released 2009-10-17
----------------------------------
SVN version: 11591

Features
~~~~~~~~
- Changed runner to ext with non-zero exitcode if any of the compilation
  tasks fail (e.g. xcc src/A.xp src/B.xp - if A.xp fails, the entire
  run is marked as failed). Can be used for chaining xcc [files] && echo 
  "OK", also useful in makefiles which will stop after failure
  (friebe)


Version 0.7.0, released 2009-10-11
----------------------------------
SVN version: 11577

Features
~~~~~~~~
- Implement lambdas

----------------------------------
SVN version: 11039

Heads up!
~~~~~~~~~

----------------------------------
SVN version: 11039

Features
~~~~~~~~
- Implemented or-equal (|=), and-equal(&=), xor-equal (^=) and 
  div-equal (/=)
